                <p class="quotation">"MDGs are the most important decisions ever taken by mankind by a consensus to dramatically change the quality of life of all poor people on this planet. These decisions were taken at the UN with great enthusiasm from all global leaders. Soon afterwards, the enthusiasm turned into indifference as the political attention of the leading nations shifted totally. Now the situation has changed. The attention and enthusiasm of leaders are back. But we have only five years left to reach these targets. We must pool all our energy and will to achieve the goals before the time is up."</p>
